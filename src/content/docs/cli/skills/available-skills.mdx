description: What your AI agent can do with Indigo Skills — authentication, signals, meetings, setup, and multi-step workflows.
---

import { Aside, Card, CardGrid } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Once your agent has loaded `SKILLS.md`, it understands the full Indigo CLI — every command, flag, output format, and error code. This page shows what that unlocks in practice, organized by skill category with example prompts you can try.

<Aside type="tip">
These prompts are starting points. Your agent understands follow-up questions, so you can refine results by asking for more detail, different time ranges, or specific filters in conversation.
</Aside>

## Authentication

Your agent can check whether you're logged in, guide you through the login flow, and detect expired tokens before they cause errors. Authentication is the foundation — every other skill depends on it.

**What your agent can do:**

- Check your current auth status and credential source
- Walk you through browser-based login when credentials are missing or expired
- Detect when the Indigo Desktop app has shared credentials with the CLI
- Handle login timeouts and network errors gracefully

**Example prompts:**

```
Am I logged into Indigo?
```

```
Help me log in to Indigo.
```

```
Check if my Indigo token is still valid.
```

```
I'm getting auth errors — can you fix it?
```

Your agent will run `indigo auth status --json` behind the scenes, parse the response, and either confirm you're authenticated or walk you through `indigo auth login`.

For full command details, see [Authentication commands](/cli/commands/auth/).

## Signals & Insights

Signals are the intelligence Indigo extracts from your meetings — decisions made, action items assigned, accomplishments noted, and key facts shared. Your agent can search, filter, and retrieve signals to surface exactly what you need.

**What your agent can do:**

- List recent signals across all types
- Search signal content by keyword or topic
- Filter by signal type to focus on what matters
- View full signal details including citations and speaker attribution

**Example prompts:**

```
Find all action items from last week.
```

```
What decisions were made about the product launch?
```

```
Show me key facts from yesterday's meetings.
```

```
Search my signals for anything about hiring.
```

```
How many accomplishments were recorded this month?
```

### Signal types

Every signal has a type that describes what kind of insight it represents.

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `decision` | A decision made during a meeting or conversation |
| `action` | An action item or task assigned to a person or team |
| `accomplishment` | A completed milestone or achievement that was noted |
| `key_fact` | An important piece of information shared during discussion |

Your agent uses the `--type` flag automatically when you ask about a specific kind of signal.

For full command details, see [Signals commands](/cli/commands/signals/).

## Meetings

Your agent can browse your calendar, search for specific meetings by title or participant, and pull up full meeting details including summaries, attendees, and RSVP status.

**What your agent can do:**

- List upcoming or past meetings from your connected calendar
- Search meetings by title, description, or participant name/email
- View full meeting details including AI-generated summaries
- Cross-reference meetings with signals to build a complete picture

**Example prompts:**

```
What meetings do I have today?
```

```
Find meetings with Sarah from last week.
```

```
Show me the summary of the product planning meeting.
```

```
Who attended the quarterly review on Friday?
```

```
List my past meetings that have summaries available.
```

<Aside type="note">
Meeting commands require a connected Google Calendar. If your agent encounters a configuration error, it will guide you through running `indigo setup calendar`.
</Aside>

For full command details, see [Meetings commands](/cli/commands/meetings/).

---

## Setup & Configuration

Your agent can walk you through first-time setup, check what's configured, and help you connect your calendar, manage API keys, and set up MCP for Claude Desktop.

**What your agent can do:**

- Run the interactive setup wizard for first-time configuration
- Check overall configuration status (auth, calendar, API keys)
- Guide you through connecting Google Calendar via OAuth
- Help add, update, or remove AI provider API keys (BYOK)
- Configure MCP for Claude Desktop or other AI assistants

**Example prompts:**

```
Check my Indigo setup status.
```

```
Help me connect my Google Calendar.
```

```
Set up MCP for Claude Desktop.
```

```
Which API keys do I have configured?
```

```
Walk me through the full Indigo setup from scratch.
```

Your agent uses `indigo setup status --json` to check what's already configured, then runs only the steps you still need.

For full command details, see [Config commands](/cli/commands/config/).

## Multi-Step Workflows

The real power of Skills comes from chaining commands together. Your agent can combine authentication checks, meeting queries, and signal searches into complete workflows — all from a single natural language prompt.

**Daily briefing**

```
Prepare me for today's meetings.
```

Your agent checks auth, lists upcoming meetings, then searches signals for each meeting to surface related decisions, open action items, and key context from previous sessions.

**Action item review**

```
What action items are pending from this week?
```

Your agent retrieves all action signals, filters by date, groups them by source meeting, and presents a structured list with assignees and meeting context.

**Meeting intelligence search**

```
Search across my meetings and signals for anything about Q2 planning.
```

Your agent searches both meetings and signals for the topic, cross-references results, and compiles a report organized by meeting with decisions, actions, and key facts.

**First-time setup**

```
Help me set up Indigo from scratch.
```

Your agent checks auth status, runs the setup wizard, connects your calendar, configures API keys, and sets up MCP — handling errors and skipped steps along the way.

**Weekly recap**

```
Give me a summary of what happened in my meetings this week.
```

Your agent pulls this week's completed meetings, gathers signals from each one, and synthesizes a narrative summary highlighting decisions, accomplishments, and outstanding action items.

For pre-built workflow details with full command sequences, see [Multi-step workflows](/cli/skills/workflows/).

## What Skills Don't Cover

<Aside type="caution">
Skills give your agent deep CLI knowledge, but there are some things that work better through other channels.
</Aside>

- **Direct database queries** — Skills run CLI commands in a shell. For complex filtering, aggregations, or cross-collection joins, the [MCP server](/mcp/overview/) gives your agent direct database access.
- **Local CLI requirement** — Skills require the Indigo CLI to be installed on the machine where your agent runs. If you're working in a cloud-only environment, MCP may be a better fit.
- **Rich analytics** — For queries like "how many decisions were made per week this quarter" or "which meetings generate the most action items", MCP's aggregation pipeline is significantly more efficient than fetching data through the CLI and transforming it client-side.

Most setups benefit from both. Use Skills for authentication, configuration, and quick queries. Use MCP for data exploration and analytics.
