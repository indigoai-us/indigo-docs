This guide walks you through setting up your AI agent with Indigo Skills — the documentation layer that teaches your agent how to use the Indigo CLI. By the end, your agent will be able to check your auth status, search your signals, and query your meetings without any guesswork.

## Prerequisites

<Aside type="note">
Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Indigo CLI** installed and authenticated — see [CLI Getting Started](/cli/getting-started/) if you haven't done this yet
- **An AI coding agent** — Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, or any agent that supports context files
- **The SKILLS.md file** — a single markdown file (~1,100 lines) from the indigo-nx repo that your agent reads for CLI knowledge
</Aside>

## Setup

<Steps>

1. **Get the SKILLS.md file**

   SKILLS.md is a single markdown file that contains structured documentation for every Indigo CLI command. Your agent reads it to understand what commands are available, which flags to use, and what output to expect.

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem label="Copy from repo">
       If you have access to the indigo-nx repository, copy SKILLS.md from the project root:

       ```bash
       cp /path/to/indigo-nx/SKILLS.md ./SKILLS.md
       ```
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Download from GitHub">
       Download the file directly from the indigo-nx GitHub repository:

       ```bash
       curl -o SKILLS.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/getindigo/indigo-nx/main/SKILLS.md
       ```
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

2. **Add SKILLS.md to your agent**

   How you load the file depends on which AI agent you use. Pick your platform below.

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem label="Claude Desktop">
       Add SKILLS.md as a **Project Knowledge** file:

       1. Open Claude Desktop and create or open a project
       2. Click the project settings icon
       3. Under **Project Knowledge**, click **Add file**
       4. Select your SKILLS.md file

       Claude will automatically include the file's contents in every conversation within that project.
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Claude Code">
       Add SKILLS.md to your project's `.claude/` directory or reference it in your CLAUDE.md:

       ```bash
       # Option A: Copy into the .claude directory
       mkdir -p .claude
       cp SKILLS.md .claude/SKILLS.md

       # Option B: Reference in CLAUDE.md
       echo "See SKILLS.md for Indigo CLI capabilities." >> CLAUDE.md
       ```

       Claude Code loads files from `.claude/` automatically when starting a session.
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Cursor">
       Add SKILLS.md to your project's docs folder or reference it in `.cursorrules`:

       ```bash
       # Option A: Add to docs folder
       mkdir -p .cursor/docs
       cp SKILLS.md .cursor/docs/SKILLS.md

       # Option B: Reference in .cursorrules
       echo "Reference SKILLS.md for Indigo CLI documentation." >> .cursorrules
       ```

       Cursor will include the file as context when you interact with the AI assistant.
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Windsurf">
       Add SKILLS.md to your Windsurf rules or context:

       ```bash
       # Add to the rules directory
       cp SKILLS.md .windsurfrules/SKILLS.md
       ```

       Windsurf picks up files in the rules directory as persistent context for your sessions.
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Other agents">
       Any AI agent that supports loading context files can use SKILLS.md. The general approach:

       1. Find where your agent reads context or instruction files (often a docs folder, rules file, or project settings)
       2. Copy SKILLS.md into that location
       3. Verify your agent can reference the file by asking it about Indigo commands

       If your agent supports a system prompt or custom instructions field, you can paste the contents of SKILLS.md there directly.
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

3. **Verify it works**

   Try a few prompts to confirm your agent has loaded the Indigo Skills context. Ask your agent:

   - "Check my Indigo auth status"
   - "Search my recent signals for action items"
   - "What meetings do I have today?"

   Your agent should respond by running the correct `indigo` CLI commands with the right flags. For example, checking auth status should produce:

   ```bash
   indigo auth status --json
   ```

   <Aside type="tip">
   If your agent does not seem to know about Indigo commands, check that SKILLS.md is properly loaded in the agent's context. Some agents require a restart or new session to pick up newly added files.

</Steps>

## Using Skills with MCP together

Skills and the [MCP server](/mcp/overview/) complement each other. You do not have to choose one or the other — most users get the best experience by setting up both.

- **Skills (CLI-based)** — your agent runs `indigo` commands in the terminal. Best for authentication, configuration, setup workflows, and scripted automation.
- **MCP (direct data access)** — your agent queries your meeting data through the Model Context Protocol. Best for data exploration, aggregations, and complex filtering.

A typical workflow uses Skills for initial setup and authentication, then MCP for ongoing data queries. See [MCP Overview](/mcp/overview/) for setup instructions.
