Indigo Skills are agent-facing reference pages that describe what the Indigo CLI can do, when to use it, and how to invoke each command correctly. They turn the CLI into a discoverable toolset for AI agents working alongside you.

## What are Indigo Skills?

A **skill** is a documented CLI capability — a specific task an AI agent can accomplish by running Indigo CLI commands. Each skill page provides the structured context an agent needs: what the command does, which flags to use, what output to expect, and how to chain commands together.

Skills are not a new CLI feature. They are a documentation layer on top of the existing CLI that makes it easy for agents to understand and use Indigo without guesswork.

<Aside type="tip">
Think of Skills as a menu for AI agents. Instead of parsing `--help` output or guessing at flags, an agent reads a skill page and knows exactly how to accomplish a task.

## CLI vs MCP: when to use each

Indigo offers two interfaces for AI agents — the CLI and the [MCP server](/mcp/overview/). They serve different purposes and work best in different situations.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Use the CLI when">
    - You need **high-level operations** — authentication, configuration, calendar setup
    - You are working in a **terminal or shell environment** (CI/CD, scripts, automation)
    - You need **structured exit codes** for conditional logic in workflows
    - You want to **pipe output** to other Unix tools (`jq`, `grep`, `curl`)
    - The task involves **account management** — login, logout, credential sharing
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Use MCP when">
    - You need **direct data queries** — filtering signals, searching meetings, aggregating results
    - You are working inside **Claude Desktop or Claude Code** with MCP support
    - You want **natural language access** to meeting intelligence data
    - The task is **read-heavy** — browsing collections, running analytics, exploring data
    - You need **fine-grained query control** — projections, sorting, pagination at the database level
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

| Capability | CLI | MCP |
|------------|-----|-----|
| Authentication | `indigo auth login/logout/status` | Uses CLI credentials |
| Signal queries | `indigo signals list/search/view` | `query_collection` with filters |
| Meeting queries | `indigo meetings list/search/view` | `query_collection` with filters |
| Configuration | `indigo config setup` | Not available |
| MCP setup | `indigo setup mcp` | Not applicable |
| Aggregations | Pipe to `jq` | `aggregate_collection` |
| Output format | JSON (`--json`) or human-readable | Structured JSON responses |
| Best for | Automation, setup, account ops | Data exploration, analytics |

<Aside type="note">
The CLI and MCP complement each other. A typical workflow uses the CLI for initial setup and authentication, then switches to MCP for ongoing data queries inside an AI client.

## Skill categories

Skills are organized around the CLI's command groups. Each category maps to a set of related operations an agent can perform.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Auth" icon="approve-check">
    Login, check status, and manage credentials. The starting point for any CLI session.
    [Auth skills](/cli/commands/auth/)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Signals" icon="list-format">
    List, search, and view meeting intelligence — decisions, actions, accomplishments, and key facts.
    [Signals skills](/cli/commands/signals/)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Meetings" icon="comment-alt">
    Browse upcoming and past meetings, search by title or attendee, and view details.
    [Meetings skills](/cli/commands/meetings/)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Setup & Config" icon="setting">
    Configure AI model providers (BYOK), connect calendars, and set up the MCP server.
    [Config skills](/cli/commands/config/)
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## How agents should use skills

When an AI agent needs to interact with Indigo, it should follow this workflow:

1. **Check authentication** — Run `indigo auth status --json` to verify credentials are valid. If not authenticated, run `indigo auth login`.

2. **Identify the right skill** — Determine which command group handles the task (signals, meetings, config, or auth).

3. **Read the skill page** — Each skill page documents the exact commands, flags, and expected output formats.

4. **Use `--json` for parsing** — Always pass the `--json` flag when the output will be processed programmatically. Human-readable output is for display only.

5. **Check exit codes** — Use [exit codes](/cli/automation/#exit-codes) to handle errors gracefully. Code `2` means authentication failed; code `3` means the API is unreachable.

```bash
# Example: Agent retrieves recent decisions
indigo auth status --json > /dev/null 2>&1 || indigo auth login
indigo signals list --type decision --limit 10 --json
```
