title: Skills for AI Agents
description: Give your AI agent deep knowledge of the Indigo CLI so it can work with your meeting intelligence data.

You can give your AI agent full knowledge of the Indigo CLI by adding a single reference file — `SKILLS.md` — to its context. Once loaded, your agent understands every command, output format, error code, and multi-step workflow without guessing or parsing help text.

## Two approaches to agent integration

Indigo offers two ways to connect AI agents to your meeting intelligence. You can use either or both.

| | MCP | Skills |
|--|-----|--------|
| How it works | Agent calls query tools directly | Agent runs CLI commands in a shell |
| Best for | Data queries, analytics, exploration | Automation, setup, account ops, scripting |
| Requires | MCP-compatible client (Claude Desktop/Code) | Any agent with shell access |
| Data access | Direct database queries with filters | CLI output (JSON or human-readable) |

<Aside type="note">
Most setups benefit from both. Use Skills for authentication and configuration, then MCP for ongoing data queries.
</Aside>

## What's in SKILLS.md

The file is a single structured reference covering everything your agent needs to use the CLI:

- **CLI command reference** — auth, signals, meetings, setup, and config commands with flags and usage
- **JSON output formats** — exact schemas for every command's `--json` output
- **Exit codes and error handling** — what each code means and how to recover
- **Multi-step workflows** — first-time setup, daily meeting prep, action tracking, intelligence search
- **Decision guidance** — when to use CLI vs MCP for a given task

Your agent reads this once and can then run any Indigo CLI workflow independently.

## Quick start

<Steps>

1. **Get the SKILLS.md file**

   The file lives in the [indigo-nx repository root](https://github.com/nicholasgriffintn/indigo-nx). Download or copy `SKILLS.md` to your project.

   ```bash
   curl -o SKILLS.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicholasgriffintn/indigo-nx/main/SKILLS.md
   ```

2. **Add it to your agent's context**

   How you do this depends on your AI tool:

   - **Claude Desktop** — Add `SKILLS.md` as project knowledge
   - **Claude Code** — Reference it from your `CLAUDE.md` file
   - **Cursor** — Add it to your `.cursorrules` or project context
   - **Other agents** — Include the file in your system prompt or knowledge base

3. **Try an example prompt**

   Ask your agent something like:

   > "Check if I'm authenticated with Indigo, then show me the last 5 decisions from my meetings."

   Your agent will run `indigo auth status --json`, check the result, then call `indigo signals list --type decision --limit 5 --json` — all without you specifying the commands.
