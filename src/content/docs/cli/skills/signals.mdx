Signals are the intelligence Indigo extracts from meetings, emails, and communications. Each signal is a discrete insight — a decision that was made, an action item assigned, an accomplishment noted, or a key fact shared. This page documents how to list, search, and inspect signals using the CLI.

<Aside type="tip">
Always pass `--json` when consuming signal data programmatically. The human-readable table format is for display only — it truncates content and omits metadata fields that agents need.
</Aside>

## Signal types

Every signal has a type that describes what kind of insight it represents.

| Type | CLI value | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Decision | `decision` | A decision made during a meeting or conversation |
| Action | `action` | An action item or task assigned to a person or team |
| Accomplishment | `accomplishment` | A completed milestone or achievement that was noted |
| Key Fact | `key_fact` | An important piece of information shared during discussion |

Use the `--type` flag on any command to filter results to a single signal type.

## Commands

### List signals

Retrieves recent signals with optional type and date filtering.

```bash
indigo signals list [options]
```

**Options:**

| Flag | Short | Description | Default |
|------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `--type <type>` | `-t` | Filter by signal type: `decision`, `action`, `accomplishment`, `key_fact` | All types |
| `--limit <n>` | `-n` | Number of results to return | `20` |
| `--json` | | Output as JSON for programmatic consumption | Off (table) |

**Examples:**

List all recent signals (default limit of 20):

```bash
indigo signals list
```

List the 5 most recent decisions:

```bash
indigo signals list --type decision --limit 5
```

List action items as JSON:

```bash
indigo signals list -t action --json
```

---

### Search signals

Full-text search across signal content, meeting titles, and related context. Results are ranked by relevance.

```bash
indigo signals search <query> [options]
```

**Options:**

| Flag | Short | Description | Default |
|------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `--type <type>` | `-t` | Filter results by signal type | All types |
| `--limit <n>` | `-n` | Number of results to return | `20` |
| `--json` | | Output as JSON for programmatic consumption | Off (table) |

**Examples:**

Search for anything related to pricing:

```bash
indigo signals search "pricing"
```

Search for decisions about a launch date:

```bash
indigo signals search "launch date" --type decision
```

Search for action items about hiring, output as JSON:

```bash
indigo signals search "hiring" -t action --json
```

---

### View signal details

Retrieves the full detail of a single signal by its ID, including content, citations, source metadata, and related entities.

```bash
indigo signals view <id> [options]
```

**Options:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--json` | Output as JSON for programmatic consumption |

The `<id>` is a 24-character hexadecimal MongoDB ObjectId (e.g., `507f1f77bcf86cd799439011`).

**Examples:**

View a signal in human-readable format:

```bash
indigo signals view 507f1f77bcf86cd799439011
```

View a signal as JSON for parsing:

```bash
indigo signals view 507f1f77bcf86cd799439011 --json
```

## JSON output format

When `--json` is passed, commands return structured JSON that agents can parse directly. This section documents the exact shapes.

### Signal list / search response

`indigo signals list --json` and `indigo signals search <query> --json` both return an array of signal objects:

```json
[
  {
    "_id": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
    "insightType": "decision",
    "data": {
      "decision": "Ship v2.0 by March 15",
      "rationale": "Market window closes in Q2"
    },
    "people": [
      { "id": "p_001", "type": "person", "name": "Alice Chen" }
    ],
    "teams": [
      { "id": "t_001", "type": "team", "name": "Product" }
    ],
    "project": { "id": "proj_001", "type": "project", "name": "Platform v2" },
    "initiative": { "id": "init_001", "type": "initiative", "name": "Q1 Launch" },
    "citations": [
      {
        "quote": "We need to ship v2 by mid-March at the latest.",
        "speaker": "Alice Chen",
        "sourceType": "meeting",
        "sourceID": "mtg_abc123",
        "surroundingContext": "Discussion about release timeline"
      }
    ],
    "source": { "type": "meeting", "id": "mtg_abc123" },
    "sourceMetadata": {
      "sourceChannel": "meeting",
      "sourceId": "mtg_abc123",
      "sourceUrl": "https://app.getindigo.ai/meetings/mtg_abc123",
      "timestamp": "2025-01-10T14:30:00Z",
      "participants": ["Alice Chen", "Bob Park", "Carol Liu"]
    },
    "createdAt": "2025-01-10T14:30:00Z",
    "updatedAt": "2025-01-10T14:30:00Z"
  }
]
```

### Signal detail response

`indigo signals view <id> --json` returns a single signal object with the same shape as above (not wrapped in an array).

### Key fields for agents

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `_id` | `string` | Unique 24-character hex identifier |
| `insightType` | `string` | Signal type: `decision`, `action`, `accomplishment`, `key_fact` |
| `data` | `object` | The signal content — keys vary by type (see below) |
| `people` | `array` | People associated with the signal |
| `teams` | `array` | Teams associated with the signal |
| `project` | `object` | Related project, if any |
| `initiative` | `object` | Related initiative, if any |
| `task` | `object` | Related task, if any |
| `citations` | `array` | Source quotes with speaker attribution |
| `sourceMetadata` | `object` | Channel, URL, timestamp, and participants |
| `createdAt` | `string` | ISO 8601 timestamp |
| `updatedAt` | `string` | ISO 8601 timestamp |

### Data field by signal type

The `data` object contains different keys depending on the signal type:

| Signal type | Primary key | Other common keys |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| `decision` | `data.decision` | `data.rationale`, `data.impact` |
| `action` | `data.action_item` | `data.assignee`, `data.due_date`, `data.status` |
| `accomplishment` | `data.accomplishment` | `data.impact`, `data.team` |
| `key_fact` | `data.key_fact` | `data.context`, `data.source` |

## Filtering signals

### By type

Use `--type` (or `-t`) to restrict results to a single signal type:

```bash
# Only decisions
indigo signals list --type decision --json

# Only action items
indigo signals list --type action --json

# Search within accomplishments
indigo signals search "Q4" --type accomplishment --json
```

Valid values: `decision`, `action`, `accomplishment`, `key_fact`.

<Aside type="caution">
The `--type` flag accepts exactly one type. To query multiple types, run separate commands or use the MCP server's `query_collection` tool which supports richer filtering.
</Aside>

### By date range (API-level)

The signals API supports `startDate` and `endDate` query parameters (ISO 8601 format). While these are not currently exposed as CLI flags, the API accepts them. For date-based filtering from the CLI, pipe through `jq`:

```bash
# Signals from January 2025 onward
indigo signals list --json | jq '[.[] | select(.createdAt >= "2025-01-01")]'

# Signals from a specific week
indigo signals list --json | jq '[.[] | select(.createdAt >= "2025-01-06" and .createdAt < "2025-01-13")]'
```

## Piping and transformation

Combine `--json` with `jq` for filtering and transformation:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Filter by type">
    ```bash
    indigo signals list --json | jq '[.[] | select(.insightType == "decision")]'
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Extract content">
    ```bash
    indigo signals list --json | jq '.[].data'
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Count by type">
    ```bash
    indigo signals list --json | jq 'group_by(.insightType) | map({type: .[0].insightType, count: length})'
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Get people">
    ```bash
    indigo signals list --json | jq '[.[].people[]?.name] | unique'
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Success |
| `1` | General error (API error, network failure) |
| `2` | Authentication required — run `indigo auth login` |
| `3` | API unreachable — check internet connection |
| `4` | Validation error (invalid type, invalid ID format) |

## Agent workflow: find meeting insights

This is the recommended decision tree for an agent tasked with finding meeting insights on a topic.

```
1. Check authentication
   └─ indigo auth status --json
      ├─ authenticated: true  → proceed to step 2
      └─ authenticated: false → indigo auth login, then proceed

2. Search signals for the topic
   └─ indigo signals search "<topic>" --json
      ├─ results found → proceed to step 3
      └─ no results    → try broader query, or list all: indigo signals list --json

3. Filter by signal type (if needed)
   └─ indigo signals search "<topic>" --type decision --json
      (repeat for: action, accomplishment, key_fact as needed)

4. Get full details for specific signals
   └─ indigo signals view <id> --json
      (extract citations, people, source metadata)

5. Present findings
   └─ Group by type, summarize content, cite sources
```

### Example: find all decisions about a product launch

```bash
# Step 1: verify auth
indigo auth status --json

# Step 2: search for launch-related decisions
indigo signals search "product launch" --type decision --json

# Step 3: get details on a specific decision
indigo signals view 507f1f77bcf86cd799439011 --json

# Step 4: find associated action items
indigo signals search "product launch" --type action --json
```

### Example: weekly action item review

```bash
# Get all action items as JSON
indigo signals list --type action --json | jq '[.[] | select(.createdAt >= "2025-01-06")] | sort_by(.createdAt) | reverse'
```

## When to use CLI vs MCP

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Use CLI signals when">
    - You need a quick list or search from a terminal or script
    - You want to pipe output to `jq`, `grep`, or other Unix tools
    - You are building shell-based automation or CI/CD workflows
    - You need exit codes for conditional logic
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Use MCP signals when">
    - You need aggregations (count signals by type, by week, by person)
    - You need complex filters (multiple types, date ranges, team membership)
    - You are working inside Claude Desktop or Claude Code with MCP support
    - You need pagination control at the database level
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
