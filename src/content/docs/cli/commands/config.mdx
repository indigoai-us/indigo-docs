The `config` command group manages your Indigo CLI configuration — AI model providers, API keys, and calendar connections.

## Commands

### `indigo config setup`

Launches an interactive setup wizard that walks you through initial configuration.

```bash
indigo config setup
```

The wizard covers:

<Steps>

1. **AI model provider** — Select your preferred LLM provider and enter your API key
2. **Calendar connection** — Connect Google Calendar for meeting data
3. **Preferences** — Output format defaults and other settings

</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
You can re-run `indigo config setup` at any time to change providers or update your configuration.
</Aside>

## BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)

Indigo is model-agnostic. Configure the AI provider of your choice:

| Provider | Model examples |
|----------|---------------|
| OpenAI | GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo |
| Anthropic | Claude Sonnet, Claude Opus |
| Google | Gemini Pro, Gemini Ultra |
| xAI | Grok |

The setup wizard prompts for your API key and validates the connection before saving. Keys are stored securely in the system keychain alongside your authentication credentials.

## Calendar connectivity

Meeting commands require a Google Calendar connection. The setup wizard handles the OAuth flow:

1. The CLI opens your browser for Google Calendar authorization
2. You approve read access to your calendar
3. The CLI stores the OAuth tokens in the system keychain

<Aside type="note">
Calendar connectivity can also be configured through the Indigo Desktop app. The CLI shares the same connection.
</Aside>

## API key management

API keys configured through the CLI are stored in the system keychain and shared with Indigo Desktop. Updating a key in either the CLI or the desktop app takes effect in both.

| Operation | How to |
|-----------|--------|
| Add or update a key | Run `indigo config setup` and select your provider |
| Verify configuration | Check the provider section during setup |
| Remove a key | Re-run setup and clear the provider field |
