The `signals` command group provides access to the intelligence Indigo extracts from your meetings — decisions, action items, accomplishments, and key facts.

## Commands

### `indigo signals list`

Lists signals with optional type filtering and pagination.

```bash
indigo signals list [options]
```

**Options:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--type <type>` | Filter by signal type: `decision`, `action`, `accomplishment`, `key_fact` |
| `--limit <n>` | Number of results to return |
| `--offset <n>` | Number of results to skip (for pagination) |
| `--json` | Output as JSON |

**Examples:**

List all signals:

```bash
indigo signals list
```

List only decisions:

```bash
indigo signals list --type decision
```

Paginate through results:

```bash
indigo signals list --limit 10 --offset 20
```

---

### `indigo signals search <query>`

Searches signals by content. The query matches against signal text, meeting titles, and related context.

```bash
indigo signals search <query> [options]
```

**Options:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--type <type>` | Filter results by signal type |
| `--limit <n>` | Number of results to return |
| `--json` | Output as JSON |

**Examples:**

Search for pricing-related signals:

```bash
indigo signals search "pricing"
```

Search for decisions about a specific topic:

```bash
indigo signals search "launch date" --type decision
```

---

### `indigo signals view <id>`

Displays the full details of a specific signal, including its source meeting, timestamp, and any related context.

```bash
indigo signals view <id> [options]
```

**Options:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--json` | Output as JSON |

**Example:**

```bash
indigo signals view sig_abc123
```

## Signal types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `decision` | A decision made during a meeting |
| `action` | An action item or task assigned |
| `accomplishment` | A completed milestone or achievement noted |
| `key_fact` | An important piece of information shared |

## JSON output

All commands support `--json` for structured output. This is the primary integration point for scripts and automation.

```bash
indigo signals list --type decision --json
```

```json
[
  {
    "id": "sig_abc123",
    "type": "decision",
    "content": "Ship v2.0 by March 15",
    "meeting": "Product Planning",
    "created_at": "2025-01-10T14:30:00Z"
  },
  {
    "id": "sig_def456",
    "type": "decision",
    "content": "Hire two more engineers for the platform team",
    "meeting": "Leadership Sync",
    "created_at": "2025-01-09T11:00:00Z"
  }
]
```

## Piping to jq

Combine `--json` with `jq` for filtering and transformation:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Filter by type">
    ```bash
    indigo signals list --json | jq '[.[] | select(.type == "decision")]'
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Extract content only">
    ```bash
    indigo signals list --json | jq '.[].content'
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Count by type">
    ```bash
    indigo signals list --json | jq 'group_by(.type) | map({type: .[0].type, count: length})'
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
