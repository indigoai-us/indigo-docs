The `auth` command group manages authentication for the Indigo CLI. Credentials are stored in the system keychain and shared with Indigo Desktop.

## Commands

### `indigo auth login`

Opens your default browser for OAuth authentication. After you approve, the CLI receives and stores your credentials.

```bash
indigo auth login
```

**Output:**

```
Opening browser for authentication...
Authentication successful. Credentials saved to keychain.
```

<Aside type="tip">
If you are already signed into Indigo Desktop, the CLI can use those credentials automatically. You may not need to run `login` at all.
</Aside>

### `indigo auth status`

Displays the current authentication state, including the associated account and token expiry.

```bash
indigo auth status
```

**Output:**

```
Authenticated as: user@example.com
Token expires: 2025-02-15T09:00:00Z
Status: Valid
```

With JSON output:

```bash
indigo auth status --json
```

```json
{
  "authenticated": true,
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "expires_at": "2025-02-15T09:00:00Z",
  "status": "valid"
}
```

---

### `indigo auth logout`

Removes stored credentials from the system keychain.

```bash
indigo auth logout
```

**Output:**

```
Logged out. Credentials removed from keychain.
```

<Aside type="caution">
Logging out from the CLI also removes shared credentials. If Indigo Desktop relies on the same keychain entry, you will need to re-authenticate in the desktop app as well.
</Aside>

## Credential sharing

The CLI and Indigo Desktop share credentials through the system keychain:

| Platform | Keychain |
|----------|----------|
| macOS | Keychain Access |
| Windows | Windows Credential Manager |
| Linux | libsecret / Secret Service API |

Authenticating in either the CLI or the desktop app grants access to both. There is no need to sign in separately.

## Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--json` | Output result as JSON (available on `login` and `status`) |
