import { Steps, Aside, Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ ([nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org))
- An **Indigo account** ([getindigo.ai](https://www.getindigo.ai))

## Setup

<Steps>

1. **Install the CLI**

   ```bash
   npm install -g indigo-cli
   ```

   Verify the installation:

   ```bash
   indigo --version
   ```

2. **Authenticate**

   ```bash
   indigo auth login
   ```

   This opens your browser for OAuth authentication. Once you approve, the CLI stores your credentials in the system keychain.

3. **Try your first commands**

   List recent signals:

   ```bash
   indigo signals list
   ```

   Check today's meetings:

   ```bash
   indigo meetings list
   ```

</Steps>

## Credential sharing

If you have Indigo Desktop installed, the CLI shares credentials through the system keychain. Logging in with either the CLI or the desktop app authenticates both — no need to sign in twice.

<Aside type="tip">
Already signed into Indigo Desktop? You can skip `indigo auth login` entirely. The CLI picks up your existing session automatically.
</Aside>

## JSON output

Every command supports the `--json` flag for structured output:

```bash
indigo signals list --json
```

```json
[
  {
    "id": "sig_abc123",
    "type": "decision",
    "content": "Ship v2.0 by March 15",
    "meeting": "Product Planning",
    "created_at": "2025-01-10T14:30:00Z"
  }
]
```

This makes it straightforward to pipe output into `jq`, scripts, or other tools. See the [Automation guide](/cli/automation/) for workflow examples.
