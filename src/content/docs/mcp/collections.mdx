description: Schema reference for the 4 collections exposed by the Indigo MCP server — signals, meetings, meeting data, and taxonomy.

import { Aside, Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

The MCP server exposes 4 MongoDB collections. Each collection is tenant-isolated — queries are automatically filtered to your account.

## Collections overview

| Collection | Description | Key use |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| `signals` | Decisions, actions, accomplishments, key facts extracted from meetings | Find what was decided, who owns what, what happened |
| `meetings` | Meeting metadata — scheduling, participants, status, recordings | Browse past/upcoming meetings, search by title or attendee |
| `meetingdata` | Processed transcripts and LLM-generated analysis | Access raw meeting intelligence and AI summaries |
| `taxonomy` | Organizational entities — people, teams, projects, initiatives | Resolve references, understand organizational context |

## Access control

<Aside type="tip">
You don't need to worry about tenancy filters. The MCP server injects them automatically — every query is scoped to your account.
</Aside>

Signals use OR-based access: your user ID in `userIds` OR your org ID in `companyIds`. Meetings use AND-based access: both `user_id` and `company_id` must match. The MCP server handles this transparently.
