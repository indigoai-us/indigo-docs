description: Practical prompts and workflows for getting the most out of Indigo's MCP integration with Claude.
---

import { Aside, Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

These examples show what you can ask Claude once the Indigo MCP server is connected. Each prompt triggers the right tool calls automatically — you just ask in natural language.

---

## Weekly meeting summary

Get a digest of everything that happened across your meetings.

**Prompt:**
```
Summarize my meetings from the past week. Include key decisions made,
action items assigned, and any important facts that came up.
```

**What happens:** Claude queries the `meetings` collection for the past 7 days, then queries `signals` filtered by those meeting IDs to pull decisions, actions, and key facts. Results are synthesized into a narrative summary.

---

## Action item tracking

Find open action items across all your meetings.

**Prompt:**
```
What pending action items do I have? Show who assigned them
and which meeting they came from.
```

**What happens:** Claude queries `signals` where `insightType: "action"` and `data.status: "pending"`, includes citation and source info, and presents a structured list.

**Follow-up prompts:**
- `Which of these are high priority?`
- `What actions were completed last week?`
- `Show me overdue action items`

---

## Decision log

Surface decisions by time period, topic, or project.

**Prompt:**
```
Show me all high-impact decisions from the last 30 days,
grouped by who made them.
```

**What happens:** Claude runs an aggregation on `signals` filtering for `insightType: "decision"` and `data.impactLevel: "high"`, grouped by `data.owner`.

**Variations:**
- `What decisions were made about pricing?` — regex search on `data.title`
- `List decisions from meetings with the engineering team` — cross-references meeting participants
- `How many decisions have we made this quarter vs last?` — aggregation comparison

---

## Meeting prep

Prepare for an upcoming meeting with context from past interactions.

**Prompt:**
```
I have a meeting with Sarah Chen tomorrow. What were the key outcomes
from our last 3 meetings together?
```

**What happens:** Claude searches `meetings` for participant email matching Sarah Chen, takes the 3 most recent, then pulls all signals from those meetings. Results are organized chronologically with open action items highlighted.

**Prompt:**
```
What's on my calendar this week? For each meeting, show any
unresolved action items from previous meetings with the same people.
```

---

## Team activity report

Understand what your team is working on across meetings.

**Prompt:**
```
Give me a summary of what the product team discussed this week.
Focus on decisions and new action items.
```

**What happens:** Claude queries `taxonomy` for team members, then searches `signals` where `citation.speaker` or `data.assignee` matches team members. Results are grouped by person.

---

## Signal search

Find specific information from past meetings.

**Prompt:**
```
Did anyone mention the API migration in the last 2 weeks?
What was the context?
```

**What happens:** Claude searches `signals` with regex on `data.title`, `data.details`, and `citation.quote` for "API migration", returns matches with full citation context including speaker and timestamp.

**Prompt:**
```
What key facts have been captured about our Q2 roadmap?
```

**What happens:** Queries `signals` for `insightType: "key_fact"` with content matching "Q2 roadmap".

---

## Meeting analytics

Get quantitative insights about your meeting patterns.

**Prompt:**
```
How many meetings did I have each week for the past month?
How many signals were generated?
```

**What happens:** Claude runs aggregation pipelines on both `meetings` and `signals`, grouping by ISO week, and presents the data as a comparison.

**Prompt:**
```
Which meetings generate the most action items?
```

**What happens:** Aggregation joining signals back to meetings, grouped by meeting title, sorted by action count.

---

## Organizational context

Explore your taxonomy to understand organizational relationships.

**Prompt:**
```
Who are the people in my taxonomy? Show me their roles and
which teams they belong to.
```

**What happens:** Claude queries `taxonomy` for `type: "person"`, then resolves team references. Results show people grouped by team with roles.

**Prompt:**
```
What projects are linked to the Platform initiative?
```

**What happens:** Finds the initiative in taxonomy, then queries for projects with matching `initiative` reference.

---

## Custom reports

Combine multiple data points for structured reporting.

**Prompt:**
```
Create a weekly standup report. For each day this week, show:
- Meetings held
- Decisions made
- New action items
- Completed action items
```

**What happens:** Claude runs multiple queries across `meetings` and `signals`, groups by date, and formats as a structured daily breakdown.

<Aside type="tip">
These prompts are starting points. Claude understands follow-up questions, so you can refine results by asking for more detail, different time ranges, or specific filters in conversation.
