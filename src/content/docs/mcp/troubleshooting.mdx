## Claude can't access my data

<Steps>

1. Check your authentication status:
   ```bash
   indigo auth status
   ```
   If not authenticated, run `indigo auth login`.

2. Verify the MCP config was written:
   <Tabs>
     <TabItem label="macOS">
       ```bash
       cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
       ```
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Windows">
       ```bash
       type %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
       ```
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Linux">
       ```bash
       cat ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
       ```
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>
   Look for an `indigo` entry in the `mcpServers` object.

3. Restart Claude Desktop. MCP server configs are loaded at startup — changes require a restart.

4. Test with a simple prompt:
   ```
   What signals do I have from this week?
   ```

</Steps>

If none of these work, re-run the setup:

```bash
indigo setup mcp
```

---

## No signals returned

Signals are generated from meetings where the Indigo bot was present. If you see no results:

- Check that you have meetings with bot recordings: `indigo meetings list --json`
- Signals may not exist for your time range — try a broader window
- Verify you're querying the right signal type. Valid types: `decision`, `action`, `accomplishment`, `key_fact`
- If querying by nested fields, use dot notation: `data.status`, not `status`

---

## Connection errors

The MCP server uses StreamableHTTP transport. Connection issues typically mean:

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Timeout on startup | Network/firewall blocking outbound HTTPS | Check network access to Indigo API |
| Frequent disconnections | Unstable network | StreamableHTTP auto-reconnects — wait briefly |
| "Unauthorized" errors | Expired OAuth token | Run `indigo auth login` to refresh |
| "Server not found" | Config not written or malformed | Re-run `indigo setup mcp` |

---

## Stale or missing recent data

The MCP server queries live data on every request — there is no caching layer. If recent signals are missing:

- Meeting processing takes a few minutes after the meeting ends. Signals appear once the transcript is processed.
- Check meeting status: `indigo meetings list` — look for `completed` status
- Meetings in `processing` state haven't generated signals yet

---

## Config file locations

The `indigo setup mcp` command writes to the Claude Desktop config at the platform-appropriate path:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="macOS">
    ```
    ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Windows">
    ```
    %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Linux">
    ```
    ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

For Claude Code, the MCP config lives in your project's `.claude/` directory or your global Claude Code settings.

---

## Multiple Indigo accounts

The MCP server authenticates as the user who ran `indigo setup mcp`. To switch accounts:

<Steps>

1. Log out: `indigo auth logout`
2. Log in with the other account: `indigo auth login`
3. Re-run setup: `indigo setup mcp`
4. Restart Claude Desktop

</Steps>

<Aside type="caution">
Only one Indigo account can be active at a time per Claude Desktop instance.
</Aside>

## Getting help

If you're still having issues:

- Check CLI version: `indigo --version` (requires v0.2+)
- Check Node.js version: `node --version` (requires 18+)
