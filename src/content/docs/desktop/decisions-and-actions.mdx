description: Automatic decision detection and action item extraction from meeting transcripts.

Indigo goes beyond transcription. After every meeting, the AI layer analyzes the transcript to identify decisions that were made and action items that need follow-up. This turns hours of meeting audio into structured, actionable output.

## Decision detection

### How it works

Indigo's AI scans meeting transcripts for language patterns that indicate a decision has been reached. This includes explicit agreements, resolved debates, confirmed plans, and commitments.

Each detected decision includes:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Decision** | What was decided |
| **Context** | The surrounding discussion that led to it |
| **Participants** | Who was involved in making the decision |
| **Timestamp** | When in the meeting it occurred |

### What gets detected

- Explicit agreements ("Let's go with option B")
- Commitments ("I'll handle the vendor outreach")
- Resolved discussions ("We've decided to postpone the launch")
- Confirmed plans ("The deadline is March 15th")

<Aside type="note">
  Decision detection improves over time as Indigo processes more of your meetings and learns the patterns of your team's communication style.

### Linking to context

Every decision links back to the original transcript segment where it occurred. You can click through from a decision to see the full surrounding discussion, including who raised the topic, what alternatives were considered, and how the group arrived at the conclusion.

## Action item extraction

### Automatic task detection

Indigo identifies action items from natural conversation without requiring anyone to explicitly say "action item." The AI recognizes task-oriented language and extracts structured items from it.

Each action item includes:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Task** | What needs to be done |
| **Assignee** | Who is responsible (when identifiable) |
| **Due date** | When it's due (when mentioned or inferable) |
| **Source** | Link to the transcript moment |

### Assignee identification

When someone is named or volunteers for a task during a meeting, Indigo associates the action item with that person. This works with direct assignments ("Sarah, can you draft the proposal?") and self-assignments ("I'll send the follow-up email").

### Due date inference

If a deadline is mentioned in the conversation — either explicitly ("by Friday") or contextually ("before the next sprint") — Indigo extracts and associates it with the action item. When no date is mentioned, the field is left empty rather than guessed.

## Use cases

### Executive daily flow

1. Start your day reviewing yesterday's decisions across all meetings
2. Join meetings with auto-capture running
3. After each meeting, review extracted actions and assign follow-ups
4. End of day: all commitments from every meeting are tracked in one place

### Team standup

1. Standup runs with Indigo capturing
2. Action items auto-extracted from discussion
3. Blockers flagged and tracked
4. Historical standups searchable for recurring patterns

### Customer calls

1. Sales or support call captured with participant consent
2. Key points summarized automatically
3. Follow-up tasks created as action items
4. Full transcript available for reference
