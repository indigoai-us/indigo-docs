## What's included

### Unlimited meeting analysis

No caps on the number of meetings you can capture, transcribe, and analyze. Every meeting gets full transcription, decision detection, and action item extraction.

### AI chat with model choice

Query across all your meetings using the AI model you prefer — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or xAI. Switch providers at any time without losing data.

### Desktop and web access

Use the native desktop app for real-time capture and the web interface for review, search, and collaboration. Both sync to the same data.

### Content publishing

Export meeting summaries, decisions, and action items. Share structured output with your team or publish to connected tools.

### Priority support

Direct access to the Indigo team for technical issues, feature requests, and onboarding assistance.

### Key differentiators

- **Desktop-first, always available** — Unlike browser-based tools, Indigo runs natively and is accessible via global shortcut from any context.
- **Purpose-built for meetings** — Notion AI is a general-purpose assistant. Indigo is specifically designed for meeting workflows.
- **Model-agnostic with BYOK** — Fathom and others lock you into their AI provider. Indigo lets you choose and switch freely.
