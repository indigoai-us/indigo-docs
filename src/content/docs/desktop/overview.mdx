Indigo Desktop is a native application for macOS and Windows that provides always-on meeting intelligence. It captures your meetings in real time, detects decisions, extracts action items, and gives you an AI chat interface to query across your entire meeting history.

## Who it's for

- **Knowledge workers and executives** managing heavy meeting loads
- **Sales teams** documenting customer calls and follow-ups
- **Product teams** tracking requirements and decisions across meetings
- **Anyone** who loses critical information in back-to-back calls

## Supported platforms

| Platform | Architecture |
|----------|-------------|
| macOS | Intel and Apple Silicon |
| Windows | 64-bit |

Both platforms receive automatic updates and share the same feature set.

## How it works

Indigo operates on a **hot and cold data architecture**:

- **Hot data** — live meeting streams, active transcriptions, real-time decision detection
- **Cold data** — historical meeting intelligence, searchable knowledge base, cross-meeting insights with citations

The AI chat layer runs across both, so you can ask questions about the meeting happening right now or one from three months ago.

## Global shortcut

Press <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> (Windows) or <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> (macOS) to open Indigo instantly from anywhere. The app is always running in the background, one keystroke away.
