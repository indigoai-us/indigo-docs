## Install

<Steps>

   - **macOS** — Open the `.dmg` and drag Indigo to your Applications folder.

</Steps>

## First launch

<Steps>

1. **Log in**

   Sign in with your Google account via OAuth. This creates your Indigo account and establishes a secure connection to Google services.

2. **Connect Google Calendar**

   Grant calendar access so Indigo can detect upcoming meetings and auto-join for transcription. You control which meetings Indigo captures.

3. **Connect Gmail** *(optional)*

   Link your email to enable meeting-related context and follow-up features.

4. **Capture your first meeting**

   Join any meeting as you normally would. Indigo detects the active meeting via your calendar and begins transcription automatically. After the meeting ends, you'll see:
   - Full timestamped transcript
   - Detected decisions
   - Extracted action items

</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  Use the global shortcut **Option + I** (macOS) or **Alt + I** (Windows) to open Indigo from anywhere. This works at any time, whether you're in a meeting or reviewing past notes.
