Indigo's AI chat lets you ask questions across your entire meeting history using the AI model of your choice. Instead of scrolling through transcripts, you query in natural language and get context-aware answers with citations.

## Model-agnostic architecture

Indigo does not lock you into a single AI provider. You choose which model powers your chat experience.

Supported providers include:

- OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-4o, etc.)
- Anthropic (Claude)
- Google (Gemini)
- xAI (Grok)

You can switch between providers at any time. Your meeting data stays the same — only the AI model processing your queries changes.

## Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)

Indigo uses a BYOK model for AI chat. You provide your own API key from your preferred provider, and Indigo routes queries through that provider's API.

This means:

- **You control costs** — usage is billed directly by your AI provider
- **You control data flow** — queries go to the provider you trust
- **No vendor lock-in** — switch providers without losing any meeting data

<Aside type="tip">
  Configure your API keys in Indigo's settings. You can also manage keys through the [Indigo CLI](/cli/commands/) using `indigo config`.

## Context-aware responses

AI chat operates across Indigo's hot and cold data architecture:

| Data layer | What it includes |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Hot data** | Active meetings, live transcripts, current decision streams |
| **Cold data** | Historical transcripts, past decisions, action item archive, institutional knowledge |

When you ask a question, the AI searches across both layers and returns answers grounded in your actual meeting content. Responses include citations — links back to the specific transcript segments, decisions, or action items that informed the answer.

## Querying across meetings

AI chat is not limited to a single meeting. You can query across your full history:

- "What did we decide about the pricing model last quarter?"
- "Who committed to the API integration and when is it due?"
- "Summarize all customer feedback from the last 30 days of calls"
- "What blockers has the engineering team raised in the last 3 standups?"

The AI pulls from all relevant meetings, cross-references decisions and actions, and synthesizes a response with citations to the source material.

## How it differs from generic AI

| Generic AI chat | Indigo AI chat |
|----------------|----------------|
| No context about your meetings | Grounded in your transcript data |
| Requires copy-pasting transcript text | Searches across all meetings automatically |
| Single-session memory | Persistent cross-meeting memory |
| General-purpose responses | Meeting-specific, citation-backed answers |

<Aside type="note">
  AI chat does not require prompt engineering. Ask questions in plain language — Indigo handles the context retrieval and prompt construction behind the scenes.
