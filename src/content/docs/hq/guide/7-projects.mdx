description: Project management in HQ — PRDs, the Ralph loop, and autonomous execution.
---

## Overview

Projects in HQ are structured task definitions that workers execute autonomously. The workflow:

```
/prd "Build X"  →  /run-project  →  /execute-task (per story)
```

## Creating Projects with /prd

```bash
/prd "Build a REST API for user management"
```

This generates a `prd.json` at `projects/{project-name}/prd.json`:

```json
{
  "project": {
    "name": "user-management-api",
    "description": "REST API for user CRUD operations",
    "repo": "https://github.com/org/repo",
    "branch": "feature/user-api"
  },
  "stories": [
    {
      "id": "US-001",
      "title": "User registration endpoint",
      "description": "POST /api/users with email/password",
      "acceptance_criteria": [
        "Returns 201 with user object",
        "Validates email format",
        "Hashes password before storage"
      ],
      "status": "pending",
      "assigned_to": null
    }
  ]
}
```

## The Ralph Loop

Projects execute via the Ralph methodology — an iterative loop of planning, execution, and validation:

1. **Load PRD** — Read project definition and current state
2. **Pick Story** — Select highest-priority pending story
3. **Route to Workers** — Architect → Developer → QA → Reviewer
4. **Execute** — Worker implements the story
5. **Validate** — Run tests, check acceptance criteria
6. **Capture Learnings** — `/learn` records insights
7. **Repeat** — Next story until project complete

### Running a Project

```bash
/run-project
```

The orchestrator:
- Reads the PRD
- Tracks state in `workspace/orchestrator/`
- Routes stories to appropriate workers
- Validates completion
- Updates PRD status

## Starter Projects

HQ ships with 3 starter project templates:

### Personal Assistant
```bash
# Located at starter-projects/personal-assistant/
```
- Email digest automation
- Task scanning across tools
- Daily briefing generation

### Social Media Worker
```bash
# Located at starter-projects/social-media/
```
- Content creation for X and LinkedIn
- Scheduling and publishing
- Audience engagement tracking

### Code Worker
```bash
# Located at starter-projects/code-worker/
```
- Autonomous coding via Ralph loop
- Git branch management
- Test-driven development

## Task Execution

Individual tasks execute through `/execute-task`:

```bash
/execute-task
```

This runs a single story through the worker pipeline:
1. **Analyze** — Task executor examines the story requirements
2. **Plan** — Architect designs the approach
3. **Implement** — Developer(s) write code
4. **Test** — QA writes and runs tests
5. **Review** — Code reviewer validates
6. **Complete** — Mark story as done, capture learnings

## Project State

Project execution state is tracked in `workspace/orchestrator/`:
- Current story being executed
- Worker assignments
- Completion status
- Errors and retries
