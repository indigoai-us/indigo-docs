## Built-in Knowledge

HQ ships with 8 knowledge bases in `knowledge/`:

| Knowledge Base | Path | Contents |
|---------------|------|----------|
| **Ralph** | `knowledge/Ralph/` | Coding methodology — overview, core concepts, workflow, back-pressure, specifications, implementation |
| **Workers** | `knowledge/workers/` | Worker framework — Ralph loop pattern, skill schema, state machines, templates |
| **HQ Core** | `knowledge/hq-core/` | Thread schema, checkpoint schema, INDEX.md specification |
| **AI Security** | `knowledge/ai-security/` | Security framework — core principles, threat landscape, checklists, incident response |
| **Design Styles** | `knowledge/design-styles/` | Image generation style guides — American Industrial, Ethereal Abstract, Liminal Portal |
| **Dev Team** | `knowledge/dev-team/` | Development patterns — React best practices, troubleshooting, workflows |
| **Loom** | `knowledge/loom/` | Agent patterns reference — architecture, state machines, thread system |
| **Projects** | `knowledge/projects/` | Project templates — README template for new projects |

## Company-Scoped Knowledge

After running `/setup`, you'll have company-specific knowledge:

```
companies/{your-company}/knowledge/
├── profile.md           # Your identity, role, domains
└── voice-style.md       # Writing voice and style preferences
```

## The Symlink Pattern

Knowledge bases are **independent git repos** symlinked into HQ. This enables:

- **Independent versioning** — Each base has its own commit history
- **Selective sharing** — Share some bases publicly, keep others private
- **Easy updates** — `git pull` in the knowledge repo updates HQ

```
knowledge/Ralph/  →  repos/public/ralph-methodology/docs/
knowledge/workers/ →  repos/public/knowledge-workers/
```

### How It Works

1. Knowledge repos live in `repos/public/` or `repos/private/`
2. Symlinks in `knowledge/` point to the repo content
3. HQ git tracks the symlinks, not the content
4. Changes are committed in the **target repo**, not in HQ

### Committing Knowledge Changes

```bash
# Navigate to the knowledge repo
cd repos/public/knowledge-ralph/

# Standard git workflow
git add .
git commit -m "Update best practices"
git push
```

## Adding New Knowledge

1. Create a new repo:
```bash
cd repos/public/
git init knowledge-my-topic
```

2. Add content (markdown files)

3. Symlink into HQ:
```bash
ln -s ../repos/public/knowledge-my-topic knowledge/my-topic
```

4. Add to `modules/modules.yaml` for sync tracking

5. Reindex search:
```bash
/search-reindex
```

## Using Knowledge in Workers

Workers reference knowledge bases in their `worker.yaml`:

```yaml
context:
  base:
    - knowledge/Ralph/
    - knowledge/workers/
    - companies/my-company/knowledge/
```

When a worker runs, Claude Code loads these paths as context, giving the worker access to all relevant knowledge.

## Search Across Knowledge

All knowledge bases are indexed by qmd:

```bash
/search "deployment best practices"
```

This searches across all knowledge bases, workspace files, commands, and worker configurations.
