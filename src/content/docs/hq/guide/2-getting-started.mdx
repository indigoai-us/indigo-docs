title: Getting Started
description: Install HQ and run your first AI worker in under 5 minutes.
---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ ([nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org))
- **Claude Code** CLI ([docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code))
- **qmd** for search (`brew install tobi/tap/qmd`)
- **gh** CLI (optional, for code workers)

## Install

```bash
npx create-hq
```

The installer will:
1. Ask where to create your HQ (default: `~/hq`)
2. Copy the template (17 commands, 26 workers, 8 knowledge bases)
3. Initialize a git repository
4. Check your dependencies
5. Optionally install `@indigoai/hq-cli` for module management
6. Optionally set up cloud sync

## Setup Wizard

Open your HQ in Claude Code and run the interactive setup:

```bash
cd hq
claude
/setup
```

The setup wizard walks you through 5 phases:

### Phase 1: Dependencies
Checks that `qmd`, Claude Code, and `gh` are installed.

### Phase 2: Identity
- Your name and handle
- What you do
- Your domains/areas of expertise
- Company or context name

### Phase 3: Starter Projects
Choose one or more starter projects:

| Project | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Personal Assistant** | Email digests, task scanning, daily briefings |
| **Social Media Worker** | X/LinkedIn content creation and scheduling |
| **Code Worker** | Autonomous coding via the Ralph methodology |

### Phase 4: Customization
Follow-up questions based on your selections (platforms, tech stack, preferences).

### Phase 5: File Generation
Creates your personalized directory structure:
```
companies/{your-company}/
├── settings/       # API credentials (gitignored)
├── data/           # Exports, reports
└── knowledge/
    ├── profile.md
    └── voice-style.md
```

## First Task

After setup, try these:

```bash
# Find what to work on
/nexttask

# Create a project
/prd "Build a landing page for my product"

# Run a worker
/run task-executor execute

# Search your HQ
/search "how do workers work"
```
