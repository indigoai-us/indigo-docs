## Worker YAML Schema

Every worker is defined by a `worker.yaml`:

```yaml
worker:
  id: my-worker
  name: My Worker
  type: CodeWorker
  version: "1.0"

execution:
  mode: on-demand        # on-demand | scheduled | triggered
  max_runtime: 30m

context:
  base:
    - knowledge/Ralph/   # Knowledge to load
  dynamic: []
  exclude: []

verification:
  checks:
    - tests-pass
    - no-lint-errors
  approval_required: false

tasks:
  source: prd            # prd | queue

output:
  destination: workspace/reports/
  format: markdown

instructions: |
  Multi-line instructions for the worker...
```

## Creating Custom Workers

Use `/newworker` to scaffold:

```
/newworker
```

The wizard asks for:
1. Worker ID and name
2. Type (CodeWorker, ContentWorker, etc.)
3. Skills (name + description for each)
4. Knowledge context paths
5. Execution rules

Generates:
```
workers/{id}/
├── worker.yaml
├── skills/
│   ├── skill-one.md
│   └── skill-two.md
└── README.md
```
