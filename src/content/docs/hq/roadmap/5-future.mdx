## Homebrew Tap

**Idea**: `brew install indigoai/tap/create-hq` as an alternative to npx.

**Why**: Faster install, no Node.js dependency for the installer itself, native feel on macOS.

**How**: Create a Homebrew tap repo (`indigoai-us/homebrew-tap`) with a formula that downloads the compiled binary. Use `pkg` or `bun compile` to create a standalone executable from the TypeScript source.

**Blocked by**: v5 launch (need stable npm packages first).

## Worker Marketplace

**Idea**: A registry where users can discover and install community-built workers.

**How it could work**:
```bash
hq modules add https://github.com/someuser/worker-email-digest
# Clones the worker, adds to workers/, registers in modules.yaml
```

Workers are already just YAML + markdown files in git repos. The module system already supports adding remote repos. The marketplace would be a curated list (GitHub repo or web page) of verified workers.

**Components**:
- Worker registry (JSON/YAML hosted on GitHub)
- Submission process (PR to registry repo)
- Quality checks (required fields, valid YAML, description)
- Star/rating system (GitHub stars as proxy)
- Categories: coding, content, research, automation, data

## Team Features

**Idea**: Shared HQ for teams — multiple people contributing workers, knowledge, and projects.

**Challenges**:
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
- Permission model (who can edit what)
- Shared vs. personal workspace sections
- Real-time sync between team members

**Possible approach**:
- Shared S3 bucket with per-user prefixes for workspace/
- Shared prefix for knowledge/ and workers/
- Git-based collaboration for knowledge repos (already works)
- Real-time: WebSocket notifications when shared files change

## Real-Time Collaboration

**Idea**: Multiple users editing the same file simultaneously (Google Docs-style).

**This is hard**. Requires:
- Operational Transform (OT) or CRDT for conflict-free editing
- WebSocket server for real-time updates
- Presence indicators (who's viewing/editing)
- Cursor sharing

**More realistic first step**: File-level locking. If User A opens a file for editing, User B sees "locked by User A" and can view read-only.

## Native Apps

**Idea**: Native iOS and Android apps instead of PWA.

**Pros**: Better performance, native notifications, background sync, biometric auth.
**Cons**: Two codebases to maintain, App Store review process, higher development cost.

**Verdict**: Stay with PWA for now. Revisit if PWA limitations become blockers. React Native could bridge the gap if needed.

## AI Model Flexibility

**Idea**: Support multiple AI providers, not just Claude Code.

**Considerations**:
- HQ workers currently depend on Claude Code's slash command system
- Knowledge bases and CLAUDE.md are Claude-specific
- Supporting other models would require an abstraction layer
- Worker YAML could specify model preference

**Near-term**: Stay Claude-focused. The deep integration is a feature, not a limitation.
**Long-term**: Abstract the agent interface so workers can run on different models.

## Plugin System

**Idea**: Extend HQ with plugins for integrations (Slack, Linear, GitHub, Notion).

**How it could work**:
```yaml
# modules.yaml
plugins:
  slack-notify:
    repo: https://github.com/indigoai-us/plugin-slack
    config:
      webhook_url: $SLACK_WEBHOOK
```

Plugins would be lightweight adapters that hook into HQ events (task complete, sync conflict, checkpoint saved) and take actions (send Slack message, create Linear ticket, update Notion page).

## CLI Improvements

Near-term CLI enhancements:
- `hq status` — Dashboard view of HQ health (sync, workers, projects)
- `hq doctor` — Diagnose issues (missing deps, broken symlinks, stale locks)
- `hq upgrade` — Update HQ template to latest version (smart merge)
- `hq export` — Export HQ snapshot for backup/sharing
- Tab completion for all commands (bash/zsh/fish)

## Contributing Ideas

Have an idea? Open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/indigoai-us/hq/issues) with:
- **Problem**: What's missing or broken?
- **Proposal**: How should it work?
- **Scope**: Small fix or large feature?

We prioritize ideas that make HQ more useful for solo developers and small teams.
