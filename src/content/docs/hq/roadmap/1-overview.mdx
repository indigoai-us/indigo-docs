## Current Status

HQ v5.0.0 is **built but not yet published**. The monorepo at `indigoai-us/hq` contains:

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| create-hq (installer) | ✅ Built, not published to npm |
| @indigoai/hq-cli | ✅ Built, not published to npm |
| @indigoai/hq-cloud | ✅ Built, not published to npm |
| PWA dashboard | ✅ Built, not deployed |
| AWS infrastructure | ✅ Defined, not deployed |
| Documentation | ✅ Built, deploying to Vercel |
| Template | ✅ Complete (17 commands, 26 workers, 8 knowledge bases) |

## Priority Order

### Phase 1: v5 Launch (npm + GitHub)

Get packages published and the install flow working end-to-end. This is the critical path — nothing else matters until `npx create-hq` works.

### Phase 2: Cloud Sync GA

Deploy AWS infrastructure, enable auth flow, stress-test the sync daemon. This unlocks mobile access.

### Phase 3: PWA Improvements

Offline support, push notifications, inline editing. Make the mobile experience production-grade.

### Phase 4: Future

Homebrew tap, worker marketplace, team features, real-time collaboration.

## Timeline

This is a small team project. No hard deadlines — quality over speed.

- **Phase 1**: Target completion in 1-2 weeks
- **Phase 2**: Target completion in 3-4 weeks
- **Phase 3**: Ongoing improvements
- **Phase 4**: Long-term vision

## How to Read This Section

Each page in this section is a **specification** with acceptance criteria. They're designed to be executable by AI workers via the Ralph methodology — feed a spec to `/execute-task` and the worker implements it.

Pages:
- **v5 Launch** — npm org, first publish, template verification
- **Cloud Sync GA** — AWS deployment, auth E2E, daemon testing
- **PWA Improvements** — Offline, notifications, editor, responsive
- **Future** — Longer-term vision and ideas
